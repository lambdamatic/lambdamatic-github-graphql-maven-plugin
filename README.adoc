A Maven plugin to generate code for the Lambdamatic GitHub Client library.
The plugin retrieves the public GraphQL API at https://api.github.com/graphql[]
and generates all the types (and some derivated types) that are used by the
aforementioned library to query on the GraphQL-based API on github.com[].
